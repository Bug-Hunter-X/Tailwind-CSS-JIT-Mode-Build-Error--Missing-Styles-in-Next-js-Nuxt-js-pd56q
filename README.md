# Tailwind CSS JIT Mode Build Error in Next.js/Nuxt.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's JIT mode with frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The problem is that not all CSS classes are correctly compiled during the build process, resulting in missing styles and inconsistent rendering. 

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the development server for your chosen framework (Next.js or Nuxt.js). You should see the correct styles.
3. Build the application.
4. Deploy the built application. The missing styles will be visible.

## Solution

Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a working solution.  Key steps often include verifying Tailwind's configuration, ensuring proper purge options, and potentially using a different mode.
