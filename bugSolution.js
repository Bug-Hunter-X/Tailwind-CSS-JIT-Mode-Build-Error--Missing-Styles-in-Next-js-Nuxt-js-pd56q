The solution typically involves several steps to ensure Tailwind correctly processes your CSS classes during the build process.

1. **Verify Tailwind Configuration:**  Double-check your `tailwind.config.js` (or equivalent) file to ensure the `content` array includes all the files where you are using Tailwind classes.  If using JIT mode, this step is critical, and often the source of the problem.  Example:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
2. **Purge Options (If not using JIT):** If you're not using JIT mode, ensure your `purge` (or `content`) option in your `tailwind.config.js` accurately includes all the files containing Tailwind classes.  JIT mode is generally preferred to avoid this issue, but this is still relevant for non-JIT setups.
3. **Rebuild the Project:**  After making changes to your configuration, thoroughly clean and rebuild your project to clear any cached or outdated build artifacts.
4. **Framework-Specific Solutions:** Depending on your framework (Next.js or Nuxt.js), there might be specific instructions on configuring Tailwind correctly within the build process.  Refer to the framework's documentation for any specific considerations. 
5. **Consider switching to JIT Mode:** If you are not already using JIT mode, consider switching.  JIT mode dynamically generates the necessary CSS during the build process, which is better suited for large projects and is less prone to this issue.
