This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses a build process.  The problem arises when Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) mode is enabled, and the build process doesn't correctly scan or include all the CSS classes used in your components.  This often leads to missing styles or unexpected rendering behavior.  Example of a component causing the issue:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-red-500 p-4 text-white">
      <p>This text should be red but might not render correctly.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
